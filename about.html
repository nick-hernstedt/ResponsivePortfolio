            A Full Stack Developer with a B.S. Degree in Environmental Science. After discovering web development online I simply couldn't get enough.  I decided to drop what I was doing and enlist in the UC Davis Full Stack Developer Boot Camp.  It was here it learned the skills that I need to succeed as well as find ways to turn my passion into a full time job.  When I'm not coding I enjoy climbing, reading and playing computer games.
